"\n## Problems\nLet $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\\log_x w = 24$, $\\log_y w = 40$ and $\\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.\n\n## Informal proof\nThe [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.\n\n$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.\n\n$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.\n\nWith some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\\log_zw=060$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1983_p1:\n  fixes x y z w :: nat\n  assumes ht : \"1 < x \\<and> 1 < y \\<and> 1 < z\"\n    and hw : \"0 \\<le> w\"\n    and h0 : \"ln w / ln x = 24\"\n    and h1 : \"ln w / ln y = 40\"\n    and h2 : \"ln w / ln (x * y * z) = 12\"\n  shows \"ln w / ln z = 60\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Convert the logarithmic equations to their exponential forms.\nStep 2: Raise each equation to the power of 120 to facilitate comparison.\nStep 3: Substitute the expressions for $x^{120}$ and $y^{120}$ into the equation for $(xyz)^{120}$.\nStep 4: Simplify the resulting equation to isolate $z^{120}$.\nStep 5: Convert the simplified equation back to logarithmic form to find $\\log_z w$.\n\n## Lemmas\n### Lemma 1\nA lemma showing the conversion between logarithmic and exponential forms would be useful for step 1.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma log_exp_conversion:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes \"a > 0\" \"b > 0\"\n  shows \"a^(ln b / ln a) = b\"\n```\n\n### Lemma 2\nA lemma showing the properties of exponents when raising to a power would be useful for step 2.\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma exp_power:\n  fixes a b c :: real\n  assumes \"a > 0\" \"b > 0\" \"c > 0\"\n  shows \"(a^b)^c = a^(b*c)\"\n```\n\n### Lemma 3\nA lemma showing the properties of logarithms when raising to a power would be useful for step 5.\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma log_power:\n  fixes a b c :: real\n  assumes \"a > 0\" \"b > 0\" \"c > 0\"\n  shows \"ln (a^b) / ln c = b * (ln a / ln c)\"\n```\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nLet $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive integers such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and $c - b = 1$. Find the smallest possible value of $a$. Show that it is 4.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and $c - b = 1$. We can rewrite the second equation as $c = b + 1$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $a^2 + b^2 = (b + 1)^2$. Expanding the right side, we get $a^2 + b^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1$. Simplifying, we get $a^2 = 2b + 1$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of $a$. Since $a^2 = 2b + 1$, we know that $a^2$ is odd. Therefore, $a$ must be odd.
